State Machine Bug Designer
=================================

This project is a fork of Finite State Machine Designer,
originally created by [Evan Wallace](https://github.com/evanw/fsm)
and modified by [Nathan Otterness](https://github.com/yalue/fsm_designer).
<br>
It is aimed to provide a means to intuitively design bug patterns and export them in DOT format for use in State Machine Bug Finder.

## Usage
Just open `index.html` in a browser and start designing. Alternatively, you can use `npx serve` to serve the page just like a server.
