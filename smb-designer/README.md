State Machine Bug Designer
=================================

The code in this directory contains a fork of Finite State Machine Designer,
originally created by [Evan Wallace](https://github.com/evanw/fsm)
and modified by [Nathan Otterness](https://github.com/yalue/fsm_designer).
<br>
It provides a means to interactively design or modify bug patterns and then
export them in various formats and be used in State Machine Bug Finder.

## Usage
Just open `index.html` in a browser and start designing.
Alternatively, you can use `npx serve` to serve the page just like a server.
