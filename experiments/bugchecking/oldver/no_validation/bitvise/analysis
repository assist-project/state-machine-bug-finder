Bugs found in prior work:

Invalid SR Rejection Response (Property 8)
Trace: KEXINIT/KEXINIT NEWKEYS/NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/NO_RESP 

Unignored Authentication Request (Property 11)
Trace: KEXINIT/KEXINIT KEX30/KEX31+NEWKEYS NEWKEYS/NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT UA_PK_OK/UA_SUCCESS UA_PK_OK/UNIMPLEMENTED 




New bugs:

Invalid Authentication Rejection Response
Trace: KEXINIT/KEXINIT KEX30/KEX31+NEWKEYS NEWKEYS/NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT KEXINIT/KEXINIT KEX30/KEX31+NEWKEYS UA_PK_OK/UA_SUCCESS NEWKEYS/NO_RESP UA_PK_NOK/UNIMPLEMENTED 
	The UA_PK_NOK should have illicited a UA_FAILURE response.


Unfinished Rekey
Trace: KEXINIT/KEXINIT KEX30/KEX31+NEWKEYS NEWKEYS/NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT KEXINIT/KEXINIT KEX30/KEX31+NEWKEYS UA_PK_OK/UA_SUCCESS 
	Since a rekey was started before authentication, new keys must be exchanged before the client can be authenticated.
	However, the server successfully authenticates before the client has sent a NEWKEYS.


Channel Open Failure After Rekey
Trace: REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT UA_PW_OK/UA_SUCCESS REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP KEXINIT/KEXINIT CH_OPEN/DISCONNECT 

Request Failure After Rekey
Trace: REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT UA_PW_OK/UA_SUCCESS CH_OPEN/CH_OPEN_SUCCESS REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP KEXINIT/KEXINIT CH_REQUEST_PTY/DISCONNECT 

	These two are symptoms of the same bug.
	Doing a rekey in the connection layer disrupts the connection, in that
	the server will disconnect if a client tries to open a channel or
	request a terminal when a channel was previously opened.


Possible bug, needs investigation:

Unauthenticated Client (Property 4)
Trace: KEXINIT/KEXINIT KEX30/KEX31+NEWKEYS NEWKEYS/NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT KEXINIT/KEXINIT UA_PK_OK/NO_RESP KEX30/KEX31+NEWKEYS+BUFFERED CH_OPEN/CH_OPEN_SUCCESS 
	The output symbol UA_SUCCESS does not appear, even though the channel was opened.
	It is likely the case UA_SUCCESS exists in the BUFFERED output.
	Needs further investigation.
