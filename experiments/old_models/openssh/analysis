New bugs:

Invalid Authentication Rejection Response
	When rejecting an authentication request, the server MUST respond with a UA_FAILURE.
	However, when the server has already rejected one authentication request, upon receiving a second,
	the server closes the connection.

Channel Open Failure After Rekey
Trace: REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT UA_PW_OK/UA_SUCCESS REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP KEXINIT/KEXINIT CH_OPEN/DISCONNECT 

Request Failure After Rekey
Trace: REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP SERVICE_REQUEST_AUTH/SERVICE_ACCEPT UA_PW_OK/UA_SUCCESS CH_OPEN/CH_OPEN_SUCCESS REKEY/KEXINIT+KEX31+NEWKEYS+NO_RESP KEXINIT/KEXINIT CH_REQUEST_PTY/DISCONNECT 

	These two are symptoms of the same bug.
	Doing a rekey in the connection layer disrupts the connection, in that
	the server will disconnect if a client tries to open a channel or
	request a terminal when a channel was previously opened.
